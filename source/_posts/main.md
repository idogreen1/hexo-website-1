# What is ESG

## Environmental
The effect of companies on the environment and the affect/risk of the environment on business. That includes energy, carbon footprint and the effect of weather on supply chain risk as an example

## Social
The relationships companies have with people and institutions in the communities where they do business, for example labor relations and diversity and inclusion

## Governance
The internal system of practices, controls, and procedures the company adopts in order to govern itself, make effective decisions, comply with the law, and meet the needs of external stakeholders such as CEO compensation and corruption policy

## Why ESG?

### Consumers
90% of millennials and Gen z consumers are likely to switch brands favoring ESG compliant companies

### Investors
Institutional investors now require firms to comply with and publish their ESG practices and sell off companies that do not comply with ESG practices

### Stock
Prices
Studies show that stock prices are correlated to ESG

### Executive Compensation
One third of S&P500 companies are using at least one ESG measure in their exec compensation structure

### Employees
Positive social impact correlates with higher job satisfaction, when companies “give back,” employees react with enthusiasm


## The Challenge
The rise in climate related disasters, social unrest and the global pandemic brought a change to stakeholder capitalism. Investors, customers, and employees are changing their decision-making processes and now opt for assets, brands and employers that treat them, the environment and our society better.

The European Commission developed the SFDR action plan (Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation) which will enforce ESG requirements, mandating companies to disclose their ESG related activities. Companies will have to change business operations to comply with these mandatory terms. The SEC is estimated to follow suit.

Today the hundreds of ESG data points are scattered in disparate systems in the organization resulting with tedious months-long work of manual collection and standardization where workflow is still not streamlined, well organized, or adopted firm-wide.

## The Solution

A B2B enterprise software that helps the sustainability or ESG executives, legal, compliance, HR and communication teams sync the ESG data collection, monitor and analyze the companies’ ESG status.
