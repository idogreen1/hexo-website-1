Project setup
Here we will create the application boilerplates, install all of the necessary dependencies, and configure the project.

The code will be commented to give you insight as to what is happening, and I'll describe some of what is going on throughout the tutorial as well.

To get started, create a new Next.js application and change into the new directory:
npx create-next-app web3-blog

cd web3-blog
Next, change into the new directory and install the following dependencies using either npm, yarn, or pnpm:
npm install ethers hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle \
ethereum-waffle chai @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers \
web3modal @walletconnect/web3-provider \
easymde react-markdown react-simplemde-editor \
ipfs-http-client @emotion/css @openzeppelin/contracts
An overview of some of these dependencies:
